Since that original hiring I have worked with Zaid on numerous projects ranging from research and copy, to coding and debugging. He is always my first choice when looking for trustworthy help. He easily conceptualizes projects and always provides his feedback taking projects to another level through creativity and enthusiasm for work. What I would say to anyone considering taking on this amazing kid as a work associate is that he exemplifies two qualities so hard to find and hard to vet for, he brings with him infectious enthusiasm, and genuine honesty."
