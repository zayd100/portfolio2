## Step 2: Create a free account

- Do login with your GitHub/Google account
- You will get 1000 credits for free
- Enjoy your free credits and use it completely in between 14 days.
- Cursor will automatically deduct credits for each action you take.

## Step 3: After the limit is over

- If you're in Windows, then you should download the chrome/chromium at-first and register with existing cursor's mail with full usage.

- Then you need to open **powershell** as administrator, make sure that cursor is closed and not running in background, it's the **crucial** step.

- Don't forget to update it to the **latest version**
